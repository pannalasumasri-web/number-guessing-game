# Number Guessing Game - Python

A simple and beginner‑friendly Python project where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

# Features

 Random number generation
Difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
Tracks number of attempts
High score system (saved to a file)
Input validation (prevents crashes)

# How the Game Works

1. Pick a difficulty level:

   * Easy: 1–10 (6 attempts)
   * Medium: 1–50 (8 attempts)
   * Hard: 1–100 (10 attempts)

2. The game generates a random number.

3. You type guesses until you find the correct number or run out of attempts.

4. If you guess correctly in fewer attempts than the saved high score, you set a **new high score**.
